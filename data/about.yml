  title1: "About me"

  text1: "<p>Hello, I’m Donavon Wall, a Canadian from Prince Edward Island, now living in Alberta.</p>"
  title2: "My Bio"
  text2: "<p>Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always had a love for taking pictures, but my passion truly expanded when I took a photography class in high school in 2012. I was so captivated by the art of photography that I often found myself skipping my other classes to focus on my personal projects—sometimes even “borrowing” school cameras (don’t worry, I always returned them at the end of the day!).

My work primarily revolves around landscape photography and action/alternative sports. I find inspiration in the stunning beauty of nature, from the breathtaking oceans of PEI to the majestic Rocky Mountains of Alberta. Each of these locations has shaped my perspective and ignited my creativity, allowing me to capture the essence of each environment.

I’m committed to continuous learning, always exploring new techniques and upgrading my equipment to ensure I provide the best quality images to my clients. Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me—I hope my work resonates with you and reflects the beauty I see in the world!

For collaborations or inquiries, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to new projects and ideas.</p>"
